# Interactive k-NN Visualization

This interactive demo allows you to explore how the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm works.
- Choose between L1 (Manhattan) or L2 (Euclidean) distance metrics.
- Adjust the number of neighbors (`k`) and dataset size.
- Visualize decision boundaries dynamically.
