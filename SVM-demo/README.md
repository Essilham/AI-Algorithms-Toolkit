# Interactive SVM Visualization

This project provides an interactive way to explore Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification. Adjust parameters, visualize decision boundaries, and understand how SVMs work!

## Features
- Choose from multiple kernels: `linear`, `rbf`, `poly`.
- Adjust regularization parameter \(C\) and dataset noise.
- Visualize decision boundaries, support vectors, and training data.
- Use linearly and non-linearly separable datasets.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Essilham/SVM-demo.git
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. run the app:
streamlit run svm_demo.py
